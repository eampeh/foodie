<h3>Food around the world</h3>

<div class=" world">


      <p> Religion, geography, culture, economy, and politics have greatly influenced food.</p>
      <br>

      <p> Rice can be a main meal with vegetables and meat added and steamed right into it, such as Indian Biryani. There's also fried rice in some of the other Asian countries or yummy beans and rice in Cuba. Rice is often eaten plain as a side dish, or with flavoring added as in North American cooking.</p>
        <br>
<br>
        <p>Vegetables that are eaten in salad or cooked as a side can really vary depending on what is regionally and seasonally available. If you're interested in trying Thai food, they sometimes include green mango or papaya in salad. In North America people love their many options for greens such as spinach, arugula, sprouts, and different types of lettuce. Options for baking, sauteing, steaming, frying, and grilling vegetables are endless.
        </p>

    <br>
        <p> Meat has been a popular staple item in some cultures, and a luxury item in other cultures for a long time. Depending on where you live, different meats are very popular; such as pork in China, and goat and lamb in India. There are many popular meats in North America, but certainly beef and chicken are among the most preferred. Meat can be put on a spit and roasted over a fire, baked, grilled in a North American barbecue, cooked in a slow cooker, stir fried, or seafood turned into Japanese sushi or sashami, just to name a few options.
